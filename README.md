# Previous Wordle Words

Previous Wordle words used since launch but with no spoilers

## Reason for being

Ever wondered if your starting word has been used before? I've only been playing a month, but realised that I've already forgotten the words I completed and have no idea of what words were selected on days before I started playing.

## No spoliers

I'll update the new word on the day *after* play, so zero spoilers. Tbh, some days I might forget.

## More stats and that
